# IPL_Data_Analysis
In  my  project, I worked on IPL Data Analysis using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The aim was to explore historical IPL match data and extract meaningful insights regarding team performances, player statistics, and match trends. I used the matches.csv dataset, which contained detailed information on over 750 matches — including teams, winners, toss decisions, match results, venues, and player awards.In IPL data project we have used Pyplot library to show the graphical Representations .My goal is to uncover the trends such as which Player has performed well from 2008-2020the impact of toss decisions, and the effectiveness of batting or bowling first. I visualized the data using bar and pie charts for better understanding . Through This project I have gained my skill in python And Mathplot Library ,which enhances my experience for Data visualization .This hands-on experience with data storytelling helped me think analytically and present results clearly.
